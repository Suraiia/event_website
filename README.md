The following school project uses Java, Spring and Thymeleaf and a mySQL database.

The website allows you to create events ("Events hinzuf√ºgen") including title, name of the person who created it, a description and the date. 
Once an event is created it appears on the website on a flip card. 
The front of the flip card displays the title and the date, the back shows the description and the possibility to join the event ("Ich bin dabei"). 
The history ("Historie") shows an overview of all the events that have been created including title, date and how many people participated. The overview is non-interactive.
